# companion-module-iobroker-ws

See [HELP.md](./companion/HELP.md) and [LICENSE](./LICENSE)

## Getting started

Executing a `yarn` command should perform all necessary steps to develop the module, if it does not then follow the steps below.

The module can be built once with `yarn build`. This should be enough to get the module to be loadable by companion.

While developing the module, by using `yarn dev` the compiler will be run in watch mode to recompile the files on change.

## Architecture

> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
> "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
> [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

This section gives an overview of the module architecture.

The main goal is to build an easily extensible framework, where handling different _ioBroker device types_ becomes trivial;
Essentially just writing a class that extends from `IDeviceHandler` and registering it in the [DI Container](https://github.com/microsoft/tsyringe).

The `IDeviceHandler` must provide sufficient information to register actions and feedbacks, as well as executing the callbacks.

> **IMPORTANT:** It is _crucial_ that the existing companion module file-layout rules are still followed and the code MUST be easy to review.
> That means, that the files `feedbacks.ts` and `actions.ts` remain in place and handle the registration logic.
> If they are delegating to the respective device handlers documentation MUST be added to provide a clear and concise description
> of what is happening, how it is achieved and why the development decision was taken. This document MAY be referenced in the code.

By requiring the `IDeviceHandler` to be able to execute callbacks, a reference to the `ioBroker.ws` websockets client is required.
The handlers themselves MUST NOT be responsible to keep track of the state; Their job is to provide information about
_which states should be subscribed to_. In contrast, it IS their responsibility to map values between the two ecosystems.

As an example, a `LightDeviceHandler` must be able to transform `RGB` color values into their respective Companion representation.

**Note:** The above class diagram does not give _exact_ type names in favor of brevity. It indicates which type is meant
by the short form of the respective NPM package. If no "namespace" is given, `@companion-module/base` is assumed.

Based on the `IDeviceHandler` is must be possible to write unit/integration tests that allow verifying that device types are not
handled multiple times. A nice to have is being able to test the individual handlers by abstracting from the underlying runtime,
i.e. companion itself.

It MUST be possible to extend the `IDeviceHandler` to create Presets over the handled ioBroker types. This is desired,
because generally speaking presets should rely only on actions defined over said types.

At least for debugging/development purposes it MUST be possible to enable/disable specific type handlers through the
companion configuration. A mechanism SHOULD be implemented that uses the DI container to discover all available type handlers
and present them in a multi-select style list.

Furthermore `IDeviceHandler` instances MUST NOT generate actions/feedbacks/presets if there are no matching devices available
on ioBroker site. If this requirement proves to be confusing for the end-user, a configuration switch SHOULD be added,
which allows to hide actions etc. in case they have no targe devices.
